# Grocery List

## Part I: Basic Functionality
---
In order for your grocery list to be considered “complete” in its most basic form, it should have the following functionality:

## Add an Item
### Add an item to the end of the list. 
### Each List item has a name, price, and quantity of purchase (ex:// “Beans”, $2.45, 3)
## Remove an Item
### You can remove an item from the grocery list based on its exact name. Capitals and lower cases shouldn’t matter, nor should additional spaces.
## Display List Contents
### At the top of each list, the user should be able to see the total price of all items…including NJ’s sales tax of 6.625%
### 1. Input Order
### 2. Alphabetical Order
### 3. Price (High / Low) ( Low / High)
### 4. Quantity (High /Low) (Low / High)
## Exit 	
### End the program and offer the user the option to display / not display the entire list at the end.
